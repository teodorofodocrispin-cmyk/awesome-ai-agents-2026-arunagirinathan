# Contributing to Awesome AI Agents 2026

First off, thank you. This list only stays useful because people like you take the time to keep it accurate and current.

There are four ways to contribute:

- **Add a new tool** - something missing that belongs here
- **Update an existing entry** - description is wrong or links are broken
- **Remove a dead project** - unmaintained repos that no longer belong
- **Improve the structure** - better categories, clearer descriptions, fixed typos

All contributions go through a pull request. It takes about 5 minutes.

## Entry Format

Every entry follows this exact compact format:

```markdown
- [Tool Name](https://github.com/org/repo) `TIER` `[Language]` `[Type]` - One sentence describing what the tool does.
```

### Tier Badge (required — pick exactly one)

| Badge | Meaning | Criteria |
|---|---|---|
| `🚀` | Production-Ready | 10K+ GitHub stars, enterprise adoption, major company (OpenAI, Google, Microsoft, Meta, AWS, Anthropic), or 100K+ users |
| `🌱` | Growing | Active community, 500–5K stars, regular commits, gaining momentum |
| `🔬` | Emerging | Novel idea, <500 stars, experimental, recently launched, or research-only |

When in doubt, use `🌱`. Maintainers will adjust tiers during review.

### Language Tag (required — pick exactly one)

Use the **primary implementation language or runtime**:

`Python` · `TypeScript` · `Go` · `Rust` · `Java` · `C#` · `C++` · `Kotlin` · `Swift` · `Ruby` · `WebAssembly` · `Cloud` · `Browser` · `Desktop` · `Mobile` · `No-Code`

- Use `Cloud` for fully managed SaaS products with no local runtime
- Use `Browser` for browser extensions and purely web-based tools
- Use `Desktop` for Electron or native desktop apps
- Use `No-Code` for visual/drag-and-drop builders with no coding required

### Type / Framework Tag (required — pick exactly one)

Use the **most specific framework or architectural type** that applies:

`LangChain` · `OpenAI` · `Anthropic` · `Microsoft` · `Pydantic` · `FastAPI` · `Multi-Agent` · `Graph-Based` · `Stateful` · `Event-Driven` · `MCP` · `RAG` · `Voice` · `Vision` · `Multimodal` · `Memory` · `Observability` · `Security` · `Compliance` · `Testing` · `Evaluation` · `Benchmark` · `CLI` · `IDE` · `VS Code` · `JetBrains` · `GitHub` · `Docker` · `Kubernetes` · `AWS` · `GCP` · `Azure` · `Self-Hosted` · `Local` · `Serverless` · `No-Code` · `Visual Builder` · `Vector DB` · `Database` · `Pipeline` · `Streaming` · `STT` · `TTS` · `Research` · `Paper` · `Guide` · `Newsletter`

Priority order when multiple tags could apply: `MCP` > `RAG` > framework (LangChain, OpenAI…) > architectural style (Multi-Agent, Graph-Based…) > environment (CLI, IDE, Cloud…)

### Description (required)

- **One sentence only**, ending with a period
- **12–18 words** recommended — specific enough to be useful, short enough to scan
- No promotional language: no "best", "revolutionary", "game-changing", "powerful", "seamlessly", "amazing"
- Start with an action verb or noun phrase that describes what the tool **does**, not what it **is**

## Complete Examples

**Good entries:**

```markdown
- [CrewAI](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI) `🚀` `[Python]` `[Multi-Agent]` - Production multi-agent framework with role-based collaboration and 1500+ company adoptions.
- [Mastra](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra) `🌱` `[TypeScript]` `[MCP]` - Opinionated TypeScript framework with RAG, observability, and MCP support built in.
- [Modus](https://github.com/hypermodeinc/modus) `🔬` `[WebAssembly]` `[Serverless]` - Serverless framework for high-throughput agent workloads with minimal cold starts.
```

**Bad entries:**

```markdown
# Wrong: missing tier, language, and type tags (old format)
- [CrewAI](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI) - Production multi-agent framework (🏷️ `Python` `LangChain` `SDK`).

# Wrong: em-dash instead of hyphen-space after closing tag
- [Mastra](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra) `🌱` `[TypeScript]` `[MCP]` — Opinionated TypeScript framework.

# Wrong: multiple sentences
- [Modus](https://github.com/hypermodeinc/modus) `🔬` `[WebAssembly]` `[Serverless]` - Serverless framework. It has minimal cold starts.

# Wrong: promotional language
- [SomeTool](https://example.com) `🚀` `[Python]` `[Multi-Agent]` - The most powerful and revolutionary AI framework ever built.

# Wrong: tier badge missing brackets around language/type
- [SomeTool](https://example.com) `🌱` `Python` `Multi-Agent` - Does something useful.
```

## Inclusion Criteria

Your tool should meet **all** of the following:

1. **Directly related to AI agents** — not a general LLM tool, not a prompt library, not a generic API wrapper
2. **Actively maintained** — last commit within the past 6 months (or a live hosted product with recent activity)
3. **Publicly available** — open-source with a GitHub/GitLab repo, or a live hosted product with a public URL
4. **Not a duplicate** — check the list first; the URL must not already appear elsewhere in the README
5. **Functional** — the tool must actually work, not just be a README with no code

Tools that are **experimental, early-stage, or have few stars** are welcome as long as they meet all five criteria. Use `🔬` for those. We value breadth of coverage.
